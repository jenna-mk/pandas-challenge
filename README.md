# Module 4 Challenge: Analysis of School District Spending and Performance
The purpose of this challenge is to analyze the test results for a specific school district, and summarize these results in various ways based on school type, size, and spending. The analysis will show any trends relating to school performance and inform future budget decisions and prioritization. 

## District Summary
The first part of this challenge is to calculate and display key metrics to give an introductory overview of the school district and its performance. These metrics include:
* The total number of (unique) schools in the district
* The total number of students in the district
* The total budget for the district
* The average math score of the district
* The average reading score of the district
* The percentage of students who passed math
* The percentage of students who passed reading
* The percentage of students who passed both math and reading

## School Summary
The second part of this challenge goes in depth into the key metrics of each school in the district. These metrics include:
* The school name
* The school type
* The total number of students in the school
* The total school budget
* The per student budget
* The average math score of the school
* The average reading score of the school
* The percentage of students at the school that passed math
* The percentage of students at the school that passed reading
* The percentage of students at the school that passed both math and reading

## Further Analysis
Using the dataframes created from the district and school summaries, the written code also provides:
* The top 5 performing schools
* The bottom 5 performing schools
* The math scores by grade
* The reading scores by grade
* The scores by school spending
* The scores by school size
* The scores by school type
The dataframes created based on the above specifications provide insight into trends in school performance and can be used to inform future decisions on how to allocate budgets, resources, and time to ensure student success.
